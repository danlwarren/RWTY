\usage{
makeplot.topology(chains, burnin = 0, facet = TRUE, free_y = FALSE,
  independent.chains = FALSE, treedist = "PD", approx.ess = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{chains}{A set of rwty.chain objects.}

\item{burnin}{The number of trees to omit as burnin.}

\item{facet}{TRUE/FALSE denoting whether to make a facet plot (default TRUE)}

\item{free_y}{TRUE/FALSE to turn free y scales on the facetted plots on or off (default FALSE). Only works if facet = TRUE.}

\item{independent.chains}{TRUE/FALSE if FALSE (the default) then the plots show the distance of each tree from the last tree of the burnin of the first chain. If TRUE, the plots show the distance of each tree from the first tree of the chain in which that tree appears. The TRUE option should only be used in the case that different chains represent analyses of different genes or datasets.}

\item{treedist}{the type of tree distance metric to use, can be 'PD' for path distance or 'RF' for Robinson Foulds distance}

\item{approx.ess}{TRUE/FALSE do you want the approximate topological ess to be calculated and displayed for each chain?}
}
\value{
topology.trace.plot Returns a ggplot object.
}
\description{
Plots a trace of topological distances of trees over the length of the MCMC chain. The plot shows the path distance
of each tree in each chain from the last tree of the burnin of the first chain. If burnin is set to zero, then 
distances are calculated from the first tree of the first chain.
If required, the behaviour can be changed to plot the path distance of each tree from the last tree of the burnin
of each chain, using the independent.chains option. This is not recommended in most cases.
