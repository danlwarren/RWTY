\title{Custom functions to load tree lists so that rwty can do basic processing on the way in.}
\usage{
load.trees(file, type = NA, format = "mb", gens.per.tree = NA,
  trim = 1, logfile = NA, skip = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A path to a tree file containing an MCMC chain of trees}

\item{type}{An argument that designates the type of tree file.  If "nexus",
trees are loaded using ape's \code{\link{read.nexus}} function.  Otherwise, it's \code{\link{read.tree}}.
If a "format" argument is passed, type will be determined from the format definition.}

\item{format}{File format, which is used to find tree and log files.
Currently accepted values are "mb" for MrBayes, "beast" for BEAST, "*beast" for *BEAST, and "revbayes" for RevBayes.
If you would like RWTY to understand additional formats, please contact the authors and send us some sample data.}

\item{gens.per.tree}{The number of generations separating trees.  If not provided, RWTY will attempt to calculate it automatically.}

\item{trim}{Used for thinning the chain.  If a number N is provided, RWTY keeps every Nth tree.}

\item{logfile}{A path to a file containing model parameters and likelihoods.  If no path is provided but
a "format" argument is supplied, RWTY will attempt to find the log file automatically based on the format
definition.}

\item{skip}{The number of lines that must be skipped to get to the header of the log file.
MrBayes, for instance, prints a comment line at the top of the log file, so MrBayes files should be
read in with a skip value of 1.  If no "skip" value is provided but a "format" is supplied, RWTY will
attempt to read logs using the skip value from the format definition.}
}
\value{
output An rwty.chain object containing the multiPhylo and the table of values from the log file if available.

Loads trees, looks for a log file of tree likelihoods and parameter values, returns an rwty.chain object containing both
