\title{Plot chains in treespace.}
\usage{
makeplot.treespace(chains, burnin = 0, n.points = 100,
  fill.color = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{chains}{A list of one or more rwty.chain objects}

\item{burnin}{The number of samples to remove from the start of the chain as burnin}

\item{n.points}{The number of points on each plot}

\item{fill.color}{The name of any column in your parameter file that you would like to use as a fill colour for the points of the plot.}
}
\value{
A list of two ggplot objects: one plots the points in treespace, the other shows a heatmap of the same points
}
\description{
This function will take list of rwty.chains objects and produce plots of chains in treespace.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data(fungus)

p <- makeplot.treespace(fungus, burnin = 20, fill.color = 'LnL')
# Treespace plot for all the fungus data

# NB: these data indicate significant problems: the chains are sampling very 
# different parts of tree space.
#
# View the points plotted in treespace (these data indicate significant problems)
p$treespace.points.plot

# View the heatmap of the same data
# Note that this data is so pathologically bad that the heatmap is not
# very useful. It is more useful on better behaved datasets
p$treespace.heatmap

# we can also plot different parameters as the fill colour.
# e.g. we can plot the first two fungus chains with likelihood as the fill
makeplot.treespace(fungus[1:2], burnin = 100, fill.color = 'LnL')

# or with tree length as the fill
makeplot.treespace(fungus[1:2], burnin = 100, fill.color = 'TL')

# you can colour the plot with any parameter in your ptable
# to see which parameters you have you can simply do this:
names(fungus[[1]]$ptable)
