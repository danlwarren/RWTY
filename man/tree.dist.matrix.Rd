\title{Tree distance matrix calculation}
\usage{
tree.dist.matrix(trees, treedist = "RF", lambda = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{trees}{a multiPhylo object}

\item{treedist}{the tree distance metric to use. The options are:
\itemize {
\item \code{"RF"} (default) the Robinson Foulds "unweighted" metric using \code{RF.dist} from package \code{phangorn}. This considers the trees as unrooted and does not use branch lengths.
\item \code{"wRF"} the Robinson Foulds "weighted" metric using \code{wRF.dist} from package \code{phangorn}. This considers the trees as unrooted and uses branch lengths.
\item \code{"PD"} the Steel & Penny "unweighted" tip-tip _path difference_ metric, based on \code{path.dist} from package \code{phangorn}. This considers the trees as unrooted and does not use branch lengths, only topology.
\item \code{"wPD"} the Steel & Penny "weighted" tip-tip _path difference_ metric, based on \code{path.dist} from package \code{phangorn}. This considers the trees as unrooted and uses branch lengths.
\item \code{"KC"} the Kendall Colijn metric, using \code{treeVec} from package \code{treespace}. This is only defined for rooted trees. The extent to which branch lengths are used is controlled by the parameter \code{lambda} between 0 (topology only) and 1 (most emphasis on branch lengths).
\item \code{"KF"} the Kuhner & Felsenstein branch score distance using \code{KF.dist} from package \code{phangorn}. This considers the trees as unrooted and uses branch lengths.
}
Note that if rooted trees are supplied, the metrics designed for unrooted trees will typically still run but there will inevitably be a 
loss of information in the tree comparison about the root position and the corresponding "depths" of tips.}

\item{lambda}{variable used when treedist="KC". Defaults to 0 (comparing trees by topology only) and can be increased up to 1 to include the branch lengths to a greater extent in the tree comparison.}
}
\value{
The matrix of tree distances
}
\description{
This function takes a multiPhylo list of trees and returns a distance matrix
populated with pairwise tree distances between all trees in the list.
By default the distance method is the Robinson-Foulds metric.

\examples{
\dontrun{
data(fungus)
tree.dist.matrix(fungus$Fungus.Run1$trees)
}
trees <- rmtree(10,6)
tree.dist.matrix(trees) # RF distance matrix
tree.dist.matrix(trees,"KC") # KC distance matrix (lambda=0)
