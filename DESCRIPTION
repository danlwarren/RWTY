Description: Implements various tests, visualizations, and metrics
    for diagnosing convergence of MCMC chains in phylogenetics.  It implements
    and automates many of the functions of the AWTY package in the R
    environment, as well as a host of other functions.  Warren, Geneva, and Lanfear (2017), <doi:10.1093/molbev/msw279>.
